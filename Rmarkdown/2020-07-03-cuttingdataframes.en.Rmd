## Episode 10: Cutting data frames

This episode is about some data frame manipulation functions.   We will "cut" data frames using the top_n and slice functions.   They are siblings to the filter function.   These functions are used to be precise on the rows you want to select for you data frame.

The code examples will demonstrate two ways to accomplish the goal.

###  Read data file

We will use the UNFAO consumption data frame from episode 8.  We use the read_csv function in readr to import the data from datasciencelive.com.   The source data can be found here at the [http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data](UN FAO data website)

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

#--------------   Read Data  --------------------------------#
consumption <- read_csv("http://datasciencelive.com/data/FAOSTAT_consumption.csv")

```

###  Alternative #1, the top_n function

The top_n function will cut the data frame based on a criteria for the highest values in this case.   There are two cases, one for all records in the data frame, and the second case is grouping the records by country.

```{r}
#--------------  Biggest consumption   ---------------------------#
top_consumption <- consumption %>%
                   select(Country, Year, Value, Unit) %>%
                   top_n(3,Value) %>%
                   arrange(desc(Value))

#---------   Biggest Consumption by Country   ------------------#
top_country_consumption <- consumption %>%
                           select(Country, Year, Value, Unit) %>%
                           group_by(Country)  %>%
                           top_n(3,Value) %>%
                           arrange(Country, desc(Value))

```

### Alternative #2, the slice function

This alternative uses the slice function for all records and grouped by country.  In each case, you should arrive at the exact same data frame as those in Alternative #1.   The important distinction for this alternative is the records need to be arranged in the order you want.  For example, we want to order the records according to the highest value.

```{r}

#-------------   Biggest consumption alternative   ---------------#
alt_top_consumption <- consumption %>%
                       select(Country, Year, Value, Unit) %>%
                       arrange(desc(Value)) %>%
                       slice(1:3)

#--------------   Biggest Consumption by Country alternative   ------------#
alt_country_consumption <- consumption %>%
                           select(Country, Year, Value, Unit) %>%
                           arrange(Country,desc(Value)) %>%
                           group_by(Country) %>%
                           slice(1:3)

```

### Mukbang

The mukbang feature is pepperoni pizza.   I baked this pizza in a cast iron skillet.  It features hand-cut pepperoni.
