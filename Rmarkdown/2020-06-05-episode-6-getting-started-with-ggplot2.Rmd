## Episode 6: Getting started with ggplot2

ggplot2 is the widely used R package to create graphics.  It is based on concepts from the academic textbook "The Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson.

This theme for this episode is to create basic line graphs using ggplot2.  A typical simple ggplot2 graph consists of three components: data, an aesthetic, and a geometric object known as a geom.


### Data: OECD fertility rates by country.

We will continue to use the OECD fertility rates by country data set which we started using in Episode 3.  The data frames which we reshaped in Episode 5 will be used for the plots.

This episode uses [Total Fertility Rates.  Download the file here](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/total-fertility-rates_5k4dpmzrg4nr.xls?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fcomponent%2Ffactbook-2013-table9-en&mimeType=vnd.ms-excel) 

Fertility rates are important for forecasting a country's population trends in the future with the assumption there is no net migration and unchanged mortality.  It can reflect a country's economic and social development, and can be very useful to help shape government policy.

### R Libraries
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

###  Reuse code from Episodes 3, 4 & 5

This block contains the code used in previous episode of Data Science Live.   We will  use it to create our data frames used in the ggplot2 plots.

```{r}

#-------------  Read OECD File  -------------#
oecd <- read_xls("c:/Users/Campanell/Downloads/oecd.xls",skip=3,n_max=42) %>%
        rename(country = 2)

#-------  Carry forward 2009 value   ----------------#
oecd_cf <- oecd %>%
           mutate(`2010` = if_else(is.na(`2010`)==TRUE,`2009`,`2010`))

#--------  Select the decades   ----------------#
decades <- oecd_cf %>%
           select(country, ends_with('0'))

#-------  Reshape data with pivot_longer  -----------------#
new_oecd <- decades %>%
            pivot_longer(ends_with('0'),names_to="year",values_to = "rate")

#---------  Reshape again with pivot_wider ------------------#
final_oecd <- new_oecd %>%
              pivot_wider(names_from = country,values_from=rate)

```

### Single line plot

Build a simple data frame with the five decades and one country.  Select the two columns on year and a country.   In this example, I will use Mexico from the final_oecd data frame.   This data frame is two columns and five rows.

The plot is a single line plot.   For this simple data structure, I use group=1 to connect the dots with a line.

```{r}
#-----------  Mexico  -----------------------------#
mexico <- final_oecd %>%
          select(year,Mexico)

#--------   Line graph  ------------------------------#
ggplot(data=mexico, aes(x=year, y=Mexico, group=1)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point()
```

###  Multiple line plot

We will use the new_oecd data frame to create a multiple line plot.   Filter on the two countries, Japan and Korea to build the ggplot data frame.   

```{r}
#------------  Two Countries   -----------------------#
jk <- new_oecd %>%
      filter(country %in% c('Japan','Korea'))

#------  Plot both countries  ----------------------#
ggplot(data=jk, aes(x=year, y=rate, group=country, shape=country)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point() 
```


### Mukbang

I created homemade Chinese dumplings.   They are seasoned with garlic and online powder and the filling is a beef & pork mixture with cilantro.  It's my own invention, and not very typical of a Chinese dumpling that you may find in an Asian store.
