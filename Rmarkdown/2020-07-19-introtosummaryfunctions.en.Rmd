## Episode 12: Summary Functions

This introduction to summary functions is to learn about the basic summary functions of averages, maximum values, and frequency counts.  Summary functions, also known a descriptive statistics, are the most common used functions for analytical reporting in all kinds of organizations.

The key concept for summary functions in dplyr is they operate on columns.  

###  Read data file

We return back to the OECD fertility rate data set which we have used in previous episodes.   The data is in an Excel file format and it is used as a report.   The are title headers and footers in the data.   We will use some cleaning techniques to remove these report titles.   More details about cleaning Excel files are in ["https://datasciencelive.com/post/2020/05/22/episode4cleanexceldata/"](Episode 4: Clean Excel Data) blog post & video.  

The source data can be found here: [https://datasciencelive.com/data/oecd.xls](https://datasciencelive.com/data/oecd.xls)

We are going to select on the starting decade years using the select helper function, ends_with.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)

#---------  Read data ------------------------#
oecd <- read_xls("c:/Users/Campanell/Downloads/oecd.xls",skip=3,n_max=42) %>%
        rename(country = 2) %>%
        select(country,ends_with('0'))

```

###  Maximum value  

Our first example is to get the highest value for fertility rate in the year 2000.

```{r}
#-------   Highest fertility rate in 2000  -------------#
max_2000 <- oecd %>%
            summarise(max_rate = max(`2000`))

```

The problem here is that it does not provide any context.   All I have is one row and one column with a number.

To get more context about the country that has the highest fertility rate, we use the filter function combined with the max summary function.

```{r}

max_2000_all <- oecd %>%
                filter(`2000` == max(`2000`))

```

### Average value

To obtain the average fertility rate in the year 2000, we will use the mean summary function.

```{r}

#----------   Average fertility rate in 2000  -----------#
avg_2000 <- oecd %>%
            summarise(avg_rate = mean(`2000`))

```

This is same as before, we have a number and no context.

We will use the filter function and combine it with the mean function to find the countries with fertility rates below the average fertility rate in our data frame.

```{r}

#--------   Countries below average fertitlity rate in 2000  ----------#
below_avg <- oecd %>%
             filter(`2000` < mean(`2000`)) %>%
             arrange(`2000`)

```

###  Frequency counts

We are counting the number of records for the year 2000.

```{r}
#----------  Count number of records   ---------------------#
n_recs <- oecd %>%
          select(`2010`) %>%
          summarise(freq = n()) 

```

###  Mukbang

Today's mukbang is pasta with spicy Italian sausage in a red sauce.   The red sauce is South American, Italian-style because heavy cream is added.   This is popular in Brazil and Argentina.
