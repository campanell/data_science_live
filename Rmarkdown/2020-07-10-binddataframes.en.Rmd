## Episode 11: Bind data frames

We continue with more dplyr functions.  This week is binding data frames with the functions, bind_rows and bind_columns.

These are data frame concatenation functions.  The functions append rows and columns of data frames.  

###  Read data file

I created two data frames which we can use for the binding functions.   The source is from the International Monetary Fund.   I have done a little tidy actions on the source data to make them ready.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

#---------  Read data ------------------------#
spain_cpi_yoy <- read_csv("https://datasciencelive.com/data/spain_cpi_yoy.csv")
netherlands_cpi_yoy <- read_csv("https://datasciencelive.com/data/netherlands_cpi_yoy.csv")

```

### Bind rows

My best practice is to make sure the columns are the same in each of the data frames when I bind the rows.

```{r}

#-------- Bind rows  ------------------------#
all_rows <- bind_rows(spain_cpi_yoy,netherlands_cpi_yoy)

```

### Bind columns.

I need to do a little bit of data frame tidy for the bind columns.   Here, I would like to have columns for the year and the CPI year over year values for Spain and The Netherlands.   I need to select my columns and rename the columns which hold the values.

```{r}

netherlands <- netherlands_cpi_yoy %>%
               select(year, cpi_yoy) %>%
               rename(netherlands_cpi = cpi_yoy)

spain <- spain_cpi_yoy %>%
         select(cpi_yoy) %>%
         rename(spain_cpi = cpi_yoy)

#---------- Bind columns -------------------#
all_cols <- bind_cols(netherlands,spain)

```

### Mukbang

Celebrating streaming live on Afreeca TV, I have Korean banchan.  It consists of fermented vegetables which includes bean sprouts, eggplant, radish, and the national Korean dish, kimchee.
