## Episode 17: Reading Data Files

This episode will highlight useful parameter arguments used for reading external data files.   It includes skipping rows, subsetting rows, and renaming columns.

### Data file

We will use the Seattle Public Art data file.   The file can be downloaded at [https://datasciencelive.com/data/Public_Art_Data.csv](https://datasciencelive.com/data/Public_Art_Data.csv)

```{r}

#---------------------   Read initial data file  -------------------------------#
library(readr)

public_art <- read_csv("https://datasciencelive.com/data/Public_Art_Data.csv")

```

### Subsetting data

We will read in the first 100 rows using the n_max argument 

```{r}

#----------------------------   Read first 100 rows  --------------------------------#
public_art_100  <- read_csv("https://datasciencelive.com/data/Public_Art_Data.csv", n_max=100)

```
### Removing the column headers

This example will remove the column headers and replace them with the default R column names which start with an X and are followed by a number. 

```{r}

#------------  No Header   ----------------------------------#
public_art_x <- read_csv("https://datasciencelive.com/data/Public_Art_Data.csv", col_names = FALSE)

```
One important note about the col_names = FALSE argument is read_csv will make all data types character.   Notice the latitude (X13) and longitude (X14) were numeric values in our previous data frames, but now are character.

You need to pay attention to the data types when using the readr arguments.

### Skip first 100 rows

We want to skip the rows and start at a specific place in the data files, so let's use the skip argument.  However, we will need to include the col_names = FALSE argument because readr will use the row's previous row as the column names.

```{r}

#-------------   Skip the first 100 rows   -----------------------#
public_art_skip <- read_csv("https://datasciencelive.com/data/Public_Art_Data.csv", skip=100, col_names = FALSE)

```

###  Rename the first 4 columns   

We will rename the first 4 columns with the col_names argument. In addition to renaming the columns, the argument will also select the renamed columns.   This means that columns 5-15 will not be included in the data frame.   If you need these columns, you will need to name all of them in the col_names argument.   

```{r}
#----------  Column names first 4 ------------------#
public_art_names <- read_csv("https://datasciencelive.com/data/Public_Art_Data.csv", col_names = c("id","commission","firstname","lastname"))

```
The readr package has a handy utility function called problems().   You can use it to debug issues with reading in the data file.
```{r}
problems(public_art_names)
```

### Mukbang: Filipino Adobo

My brother-in-law, Chef Lou made this traditional Filipino dish and it is one of its national dishes.   Adobo is the first Filipino dish which I discovered.
